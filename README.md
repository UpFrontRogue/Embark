PLEASE READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING!

Embark is a medium paced, D&D style RPG game that is text based and is currently in the works to make it an apk for the google play store. I appreciate the time you are taking to read this.

BEFORE INSTALL:

Download all the .py files in the "Files" folder of Github. I personally recommend putting them all In a file to move around easier. Also

INSTALL ON:

COMPUTER:

please Create a folder on your device named Embark (this one doesn't specifically have to be named Embark, but it helps with simplicity) then inside of that folder, 
create a folder named "Saves" and "Files". Put all of the .py files in "Files". And you are setup and ready to go. main.py is the file to run.

ANDROID:

Do all steps for COMPUTER, then install on your android device the application "PyCode". This lets you run and test Python code. Run main.py to start the game.
If you cannot play, try giving "PyCode" perms for Storage.

ABOUT ME:

I originally created Embark as a Character Storage for my twist on a custom D&D game me and my friends play, then decided to keep going, so I added a explore and roll dice feature,
then I added battles, then an inventory, and so on and so forth. I kept going until we have what we do today. As far as I know, Embark can be played on all devices, but have not tested it
on IOS or any android devices below Android 13. I am well more than happy to fix bugs with is, as I want this game to be amazing. Warning: some bugs are likely to stay in if they are funny,
not completely broken, or if you have to go through extreme lengths to get to it (in certain cases).

Thank you for Downloading and Installing "Embark". I really appreciate the fact that you took the time to both read this, and play my game. I hope you enjoy Embark as much I love creating it.
Please allow me to make updates on "Embark", as I try to take feedback seriously.
